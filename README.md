# word-decryptor
Word Decryptor is a JavaScript game created with React, Node, and Express.

## Installation
Clone the repo. Next, run two scripts: 
(1) ```npm start``` to start the nodemon server
(2) ```npm run build``` to build webpack.

## Usage
Type in a four-letter word and get back 'X' and 'O' clues that will help you solve the password.

For example: if the password is "coal" and your guess is "love", 
you would receive "X O," which indicates that you have guessed correctly one letter 
in the correct position and one letter in the wrong position.
